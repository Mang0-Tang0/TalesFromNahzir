<p>Your mind was good, but your brain wasn’t. What the heck is going on in your mind that you would choose the ever more dangerous path?! Monsters get progressively smart and start to overcome you. There was a group of 20 giant lizards coming at your way halfway from meeting the heroes. ...You made good progress going there but all is in vain if you don’t get with somebody to watch your back. You managed to take one giant lizard to the grave before everything went downhill. 3 lizards maul your body to death.</p>
<p>Nice going! You wasted all that built up momentum from a while ago.</p>
