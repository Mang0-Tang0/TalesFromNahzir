<p>You can feel fear grasping at the depth of your soul. As you continue to move forward to the mysterious blobs. You stop your tracks, realizing that if you trust them without any basis to go upon using them, it will lead to your downfall. Your legs start to give away, but you need strength in your legs right now. After steeling yourself for a brave retreat, you start to run back to the safe path. Your breathing starts to go erratic. Sweat forms from your head to your legs. A pang was felt from the mark on your right hand. It grows rapidly and soon covers your whole body. You scream out a silent wind. Nothing could be heard from your voice. Soon, the darkness of the mark consumes your whole body and you cease to exist. Calamity has once won the battle against humanity. </p>
