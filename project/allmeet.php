<p>You decided to give them the bag. As you untie the bag from your waist, you threw it towards them to direct their attention away from you and run fast towards the end of the safe path. You manage to safely escape from certain death!</p>
<p>After running for a few more miles, you see a strange building in the distance. After coming a bit closer to the building, you see that it’s a dungeon that has a strange mark. That mark has a similar design to the scar on your hand. That means that it’s the dungeon where you meet up with the heroes. You ran with all your might towards the dungeon. Then all off a sudden, you are struck with something that caused all of your senses to go haywire. Still you ran into two odd figures next to each other in front of the dungeon. They look disfigured from here and by their side are two large weapons, one staff and one giant sword.</p>
<p>What will you do?</p>
