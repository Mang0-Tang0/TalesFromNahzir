<p>Nazhir. A world full of life and filled with bountiful ruins to explore. It is a beautiful place with animals, monsters, and the most abundant of them all: humans.

They farm animals for their edible meat, they kill monsters that tend to differ from the looks of humans, and they loot them for valuables they hold. It was truly and adventurous world that sparked the hearts of humans.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>There was something that disrupted this world at random times of advanced civilization. A calamity that is feared among all the living creatures on this planet.

It’s their destiny that the whole world is depending on, and mostly importantly, themselves. If they choose to die before meeting the calamity, it only serves to speed the process of the reset. Ultimately, it is their choice whether to abandon this world, or let it thrive for another impending danger…</p>
