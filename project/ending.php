<p>You choose a random path to take. It was 1/26 chance to get the path right, and there's no harm in turning back and choosing a different one. It was just time consuming. It was a long set of stairs. Ah what a pain. For you that is. You might have the strongest legs there is but stairs are your number one enemy. It was quite a workout to behold. The air is thick with a miasma fog. The marks on the right arms are starting to burn from it. The pulses increase with every step taken getting closer to the calamity.</p>
<p>“By the gods and goddesses, how long do these stairs last? There's no end of it at all!” the first one to complain is Fareene. It’s understandable that she would complain, but she’s hovering with magic… You feel slightly jealous of that magic spell. It was quite a high level one. Gravity spells are considered top tier in the world of mages. How envious.. I want to use magic-- I mean. It’s too convenient.</p>
<p>“Quiet Fareene. We’re all exhausted from these stairs too. Aren’t you having a bad time too?” Elrique passes the question towards you.“Of course. Stairs are the number one enemy to legs! Seriously, you would think that someone could invent a device that could go straight up without using magic can’t they…? Oh wait. This calamity doesn’t allow advancement…”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>You all sigh at the same time. That’s right. This calamity doesn’t allow advancement of humanity. For the whole world actually. If this one isn’t stopped in time, All of humanity will have to start over before they even reach that kind of development...</p>
<p>You and the other two heroes could finally see the light-- or Calamity- at the top of the staircase. After climbing the stairs for a more than five hours. It looks likes you picked the right path after all! (It wasn’t like it was all going to lead to the same place at the same time anyways). The Calamity is thickening the air and hard to breathe. Not to mention, the air itself from such a high altitude might make one light headed. </p>
<p>“It’s… hard to… breathe…” Fareene states. She looks like she was about to collapse. No, not just her but you and Elrique. The mark was pulsing like crazy on all of you too.</p>
<p>“So… This is the calamity…!” You manage to squeeze a bit of voice left inside of you to shout out that statement. It was your way of making the group come back collectively and stick together. It was effective. Both Fareene and Elrique snapped out of the fear that took told of them. This feeling was similar to the fear back at the entrance. “It’s alright! We got this!” Boosting the morale of your comrade, they seem invigorated by your words.</p>
<p>Yes… nothing will stop you from destroying this Calamity! As you and the heroes stand up and give a shout from your spirits, you all charge at the Calamity.  And so, the three marks from you and the heroes start glowing brighter than the sun. It’s a blinding light but gentler on the eyes. They combined to make something that resembled a familiar delicacy you like. It was 
    
      <?php if(isset($_COOKIE["foods"])) {
        Echo strtoupper($_COOKIE["foods"]);
        }?>     
! The 
    
      <?php if(isset($_COOKIE["foods"])) {
        Echo strtoupper($_COOKIE["foods"]);
        }?> 
    
    launched straight into the eye of the calamity. All of a sudden, the Calamity stops in its tracks.</p>
<p class="italics">...What’s going on?</p>
<p>You all have a dubious face from the turn of events. After the Calamity calms down, it then shrinks into the size of a person.</p>
<p>“Hey thanks! I needed this!” The person that emerged from the Calamity’s main body comes out saying that. The marks on your arm are gone. “Well, I’m going back to sleep. Seeya new heroes!~” The person left the dungeon.</p>
<p class="italics">...Huh?</p>
