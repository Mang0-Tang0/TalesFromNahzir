<p>You approach the two dark blobs in front of the dungeon. The sudden dizziness disappears altogether and suddenly, the two mysteries figures turned into something resembling a mage and a lancer.</p>
<p>“You passed the trial.”</p>
<p>“Mhm, it didn’t last very long.” The two spoke out to you. They gave a sigh of relief once they saw their last comrade is capable of perceiving friend or foe.</p>
<p>“Uhh… I guess nice to meet you.” You say to them.</p>
<p>“Likewise, nice to finally meet the last hero. Were you far away from here?” The lancer asks. “Yeah, I had to take that safe path.” You answer.</p>
<p>“Mm, yeah that’s a pretty far long distance you had to travel. But it usually takes days just to travel it though. How’d you do it?”</p>
<p>“With running at full power. I’m confident in my leg and stamina!”</p>
<p>“Huh, that means you’re good at dodging. We haven’t introduced ourselves yet. I’m Elrique. As you can tell by my weapon, I am usually frontline of the expedition.” Elrique explains.</p>
<p>“I’m Fareene. Mage at your service, pleasure to serve.” The quiet girl near Elrique peeks her head out as to introduce herself</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you.” You return the lip service. With introductions done, you and the rest of the heroes think of a formation before you fight the calamity. Elrique is frontline as he mainly positioned there whenever he was with his squadron back in the main kingdom. You are the middle position. Middle position is an all rounder as they will provide support to the front line attacker and participate in battle as much as they can to speed the process. Fareee is backline. She has little defense but long range magic makes up with her glass stature. Her spells are long to chant so leaving her in the back with provide time. Enemies won’t be able to lay a finger on her from that distance. The formation is set. It is the perfect strategy against the calamity.</p>
<p>“Are we all set and ready to go? The calamity is that storm cloud up above the dungeon.” Elrique spoke out soon after you and the gang were set in stone with the strategy. </p>
<p>“”We’re ready.”” You and Fareene both answered at the same time. With that being said, you walk into the dungeon where everything was covered in a thick black smog. Elrique lights a torch that came out from under his cape. He was well prepared for what’s going to come. The torch illuminates the path in front. It clears a path for you to take. But there are 26 paths to choose from!</p>
<p>Which one is the right one to choose?</p>
