<p>You choose the safe path. That’ll make the trip much easier. On the road of the safe path, it is nice and smooth. It’s quite easy to walk through. There were slimes and other weak-looking monsters that were hostile and coming towards your way, but you attacked them without mercy. Everything was proceeding smoothly as the journey continues, you gain some experience fighting the weaker monsters. It was a pretty long path as well. It might as well be the loophole of the first path as you could see the end of the path clearly through the dangerous path. Tedious as it may be, it was better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>As you were walking around, you hear a shuffling noise coming through the woods off the path. There were hints of whispers coming through the trees. You knew it was dangerous situation as you were close to the dungeon where the heroes are supposed to meet. You shout, “Show yourself!” to the mysterious rustling noises.</p>
<p>Two figures emerge from the trees’ shadows. They casually make their way to the dirt path. They come closer almost like they’re giggling.</p>
<p>“Heheh, never thought you could here us in the woods there, pal.”</p>
<p>“You’re wearing something fancy around your waist. Lemme see it..” They’re flaunting their weapons as they come closer.</p>
<p>Dangerous! These people are dangerous! They look pretty high levelled, too. And there are more of them than they are more of you. They were looking at the fancy bag you had around your waist in case of emergency. It’s something like an important heirloom you kept in the shed for safety. But the world is ending anytime soon. There’s not going to be a time where you can use it unless the calamity disappears.</p>
<p>So, what will you do?</p>

<p class="center">
    <a href="allmeet.php">Just give the bag to them. It's not going to do you any good if the world ends an you're dead.</a>
</p>
<p class="center">
    <a href="death3.php">Tell them that it's an important item and ask them to leave.</a>
