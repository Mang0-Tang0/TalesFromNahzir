<p>Blackened sand has spread as far as your eye can see. Smoke-like clouds cover the beautiful violet dyed sky that once covered the past days. It hurts… it hurts…! Your body sees the destruction that was within your vision. A mark on your arm slowly covered your entire body like a snake coiling its prey. You struggle to get out of it, but it was already part of your body, not evening skinning your body trying to rid of the impurity on your skin can erase the mark. It soon covers your whole body, and soon, becomes part of the blackened scene. It enhances the encroachment of the darkness covering the whole world. “At least I won’t be the only one.”</p>
<p>You wake up in a cold sweat. It was a dream, but it was a dream that felt too real. You feel a pain in your right hand. There was a deformity; a mark as you say. It was a mark that was told in stories passed down from generation to generation: the Calamity sigil. It throbs slightly but it doesn’t hurt yet. And the mark was fairly small and that means there’s still a lot of time before the final clash against the calamity. But this freaks you out. YOU are one of the destined to save the world from another reset. The fate of the world lays heavily upon your shoulders…</p>
<p>Now… what will you do?</p>
